Why should I use py-jsonapi?
============================

**It's easy and extendable** and supports **ansynchronous and blocking code**.
It comes with built in support for many web frameworks and ORMs, like:

*   flask
*   tornado
*   motorengine
*   mongoengine
*   sqlalchemy

If a database is not supported, you can easily create your own
database adapter. Integrating the API in another web framework
is even easier.

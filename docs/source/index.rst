Description
-----------

This library implements the http://jsonapi.org specification in **Python 3**.
It is easy to use, extendible and there are :ref:`extensions` for Flask,
SQLAlchemy, mongoengine and Tornado, ... which make your job even easier.

Let's take a look at the :ref:`examples <blog-api>`, where we will
implement a blog using *mongoengine* and *flask*.
